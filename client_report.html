		<h2>client report</h2>
		<p>Building the wirframe for my website and deciding what to put on it wasnt too hard once i figureout what i wanted my website to be. i communicated with my lead developer through teams, I think the lead dev did a good job with building my website and communicated about changing up the colors and freedom of creativity. Next time I think I woud try and make it more detailed.</p>
		<h2>Lead Dev report</h2>
		<p>While I was the lead developer I at fist took a while to get started but once i got going I was checking in asking questions to my junior developers and to my client through teams. I had each of the junior developers submit their own pages to github and then i would do the more tedious editing to get the linking between the site working and fixing anyissues with the CSS</p>
		<h2>junior dev report</h2>
		<p>As a junior Developer I did feel like there wasnt that much that i had to do. the pages were pretty simple with not much to it. Luckily I didnt find any issues with adding my stuff the github as a junior developer. I was also the only one on my junior dev. groups to have my stuff submitted in github so i didnt really know what to do for a while.</p>
		<h2>General experiance and reflection</h2>
		<p>Communication and finding time to get my pages done. like for example, asking about progress on a page or even asking to be added to the github repository took forever to get a response</p>
